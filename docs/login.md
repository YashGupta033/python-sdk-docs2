As a trader or investor, if you need to make a trade, the first step is obviously to login into your trading account; trading with api's is also the same, the first step is to login, not manually but with the api.

Pocketful boasts a robust and secure login mechanism fortified by two-factor authentication. Initially, users submit their credentials, and the server validates them, responding with a success confirmation if they are accurate. Following this, the client is prompted to provide the Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) for two-factor authentication. Upon successful verification of the TOTP, the server issues an access token, a crucial credential enabling seamless access to our APIs and retrieval of data.
