The bull call spread strategy is advantageous for those with a moderately bullish stance on a stock or index. While traditionally involving at-the-money (ATM) and out-of-the-money (OTM) options, it offers flexibility in selecting strike prices. To implement this strategy, one buys an ATM call option (leg 1) and simultaneously sells an OTM call option (leg 2).
