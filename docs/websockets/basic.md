## Websockets

Websockets are a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived TCP connection. This protocol enables real-time data transfer between a client and a server, allowing them to exchange messages in both directions simultaneously. Unlike traditional HTTP connections, which follow a request-response model and require separate connections for each request, Websockets establish a persistent connection that remains open as long as needed.

In contrast to HTTP, where a client initiates communication by sending a request to a server and waits for a response, Websockets allow for bidirectional communication. This means that once the connection is established, either the client or the server can initiate the exchange of data at any time without waiting for a request. This capability is particularly useful for applications that require real-time updates or interactive communication, such as chat applications, online gaming, financial trading platforms, and live data streaming services.

The process of establishing a connection in Websockets involves a handshake mechanism. Initially, the client sends an HTTP request to the server, indicating its intent to upgrade the connection to a WebSocket connection. If the server supports Websockets, it responds with an HTTP 101 status code (Switching Protocols) along with the necessary headers to indicate the protocol upgrade. Subsequently, the connection transitions from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol, and both the client and server can start exchanging messages in a full-duplex manner. This handshake process typically occurs during the initial connection establishment and allows for seamless transition to the WebSocket protocol, enabling efficient real-time communication between the client and server.
